The Classic Fizz Buzz Problem
==============================

.. rst-class:: left

    Fizz Buzz is a classic simple problem in computer science.

    Often used as an exercise in interviews for programmers.

    Apparently a LOT of people applying for jobs as profesional developers can't do this in an interview:

    (http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest)

    Now that I've psyched you out -- it's really pretty straightforward.

Goal:
-----

* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

* But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number

* For the multiples of five print "Buzz".

* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz" instead.

Hint:
-----

* Look up the ``%``  operator. What do these do?

  * ``10 % 7 == 3``
  * ``14 % 7 == 0``

(try that in iPython)

* Do try to write it without looking it up -- there are a million nifty solutions posted on the web.

Results:
--------

Running your code should result in something like::

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16
    ....
