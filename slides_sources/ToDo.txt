Things to do for the UWPCE INtro to Python class:

For Session 2:

Note: I decided to not confuse things with unicode off teh bat --
so I'm stripping the 'u' from string literals wherever I find them.

[x] Update presentaion for UWPCE instead of CodeFellows
[x]  - mention of CodeFellows
[x]  - urls for git

[x] Add outline of class to beginning of slides

[x] Add section breaks to slides for LAB time and lightning talks:
    some lecture
    some lab time
    two lightning talks

[ ] General slide proofread and clean up for layout, etc.

I think we shouod remove the parameter unpacking: *args and **kwargs --
too much when you don't really know what a tuple or dict is...

[x] Remove parameter unpacking

[ ] Add more to the function lab -- should be 20min or so of work.
  - they have learned about returning multiple values.

[ ] Put in solution to this weeks homework in Solutions
  --Chris has soem kicking around to find...


Future Sessions:

Add discusion of parameter unpacking: *args and **kwargs
