# Hey Chris, my topic idea is something like this:
# User inputs a protein sequence (string of amino acids)
# And my program will spit out a slew of information on the peptide string
# I haven't decided exactly what information it will spit out but it'll be something like this:
# % aromaticity, % composition, disulfide bonds, etc.
# If I can manage, I'll try to get a visual of it or something cool like that
