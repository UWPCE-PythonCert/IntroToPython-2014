#GIT
"""
-git is a graph.  A graph is something with "states" and "places" with paths between them.
For example your code will have many versions ("states") with points between them.
-each place in the history of git has a name that identifies it (called a "hash")
-there are labels that can point to the different places in time.
    - "Head" is the label at the current point in time that you're looking at.
    - "master" is the name that git auomatically gives to the first branch in a repository
    - "branch" is a different version of the original master branch
-creating branches allows you to submit just the specific homework you changed in
 your pull request
-when you create your pull request, you want to make sure you're comparing your
 branch to the master to PCE's repository
-you start with a local database and then pull to the web
-you always start locally; this creates a ".git" folder

-git setup:
    -have gui
    -have command line
    -have github account

-git settings:
    -system: settings for your system
    -global: settings for your user account
    -local: highest prescedence; settings specific for your local project

-initalizing a repository:
    -this can happen locally or in the cloud at github.com
    -locally:
        -"git init" turns an existing project into a git project
        -"git init <project_name> creates a new project as a git project
    -in the cloud:
        -look for "New Repository" and create a repository
        -README: this tell others about the project
        -.gitignore: this tells git which projects to ignore

-committing:
    -changes are commits
    -local commits:
        -"git status" tells you with files should be committed
        -"git add" adds files to the staging area; the purpose of the staging
         area is to give users the ability to choose which changes are part of
         which commit.
        -"git commit -m <message>" will commit the changes; each commit should
         be part of a story
    -github.com commits:
        -use the edit button on the website
        -this is good for making simple changes to text files

-diff:
    -what changes have you made to your code that hasn't been staged?
    -"git diff": this tells you how your working tree (i.e., files) differs
     from the staging area
    -"git diff --staged" this tells you how your staging area is different
     from the lastest commit in history
    -"git diff HEAD" how your working tree compares to the HEAD commit
    -"git diff --word-diff" easier to read diffs
    -"git diff --color-words" easier to read diffs
    -"git diff --stat" just tells you the files that have changed

-log:
    -"git log" shows all the commits to the repository; new on top, oldest at
     the bottom
    -"git log --oneline" shows a summary of all the commits
    -"git log --stat" shows the commit message with the files for each commit
    -"git log --patch" shows the diff between all the commits
    -"git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline"
    -you can use all of these options together

-removing files:
    -"git rm" removes the file from the directory and stages the removal
    -"git add -u ." goes through the working tree and stages all deleted files;
     the "." means that git will look at all directories in the working tree
    -"git rm --cahced <filename>" removes from the git repository but not the
     file system

-moved files:
    -"git mv <old_path> <new_path>" this will move a file; if you don't use this
     command and do the move using the file system, git will think you deleted
     then added a file.  you can fix this by deleted the old file "git rm <file>"
     and adding the new file "git add <file".
    -"git add -A ." this finds all the new files and old files and tells git that
     they have been moved

-ignore:
    -to ignore files, create a ".gitignore" file in the root of the project
    -e.g., "touch .gitignore" "git add .gitignore" "git commit -m <message>"
    -you can put file names, directories, or wildcard character (i.e., "*")
    -you can also have a .gitignore file in a sub directory, which takes presedence
    -"git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard" shows all the excluded
     files

-branch:
    -new features and bug fixes should be done on a new branch
    -why use branches?
        -the master branch should be a representation of "production"
    -"git branch <name>" creates a new branch
    -"git branch -d <name>" deletes a branch
        -you cannot delete the branch you are currently on
    -"git checkout <name>"
        -this moves changes in staging area and working directory to new branch
        -can't switch to a new branch when moving to that branch affects staging
         files or working tree files
        -you might see different files when you are on different branches; this
         is fine and how git works
    -"git branch":  lists all the current branches (* is the branch you're on)
    -"git branch -v": lists all the current branches with last commit
    -"git branch --merged": lists the branches that are already merged into the
     branch you're on. branches without a "*" in front are generally fine to delete
    -"git branch --no-merged": lists the branches that contain work that hasn't
     been merged in

-more branching notes:
    -a branch is a movable pointer to one of your commits
    -when you first start a git repository, the default branch is named master
     and it points to the last commit you made
    -creating a new branch creates a new pointer for you to move around; the
     default location when you create a new branch is the commit you're currently
     on
    -how does git know what branch you're on? It keeps a special pointer named
     HEAD. HEAD is a pointer to the local branch you're currently on.
    -"git checkout" lets you switch to a new branch.  This moves HEAD to to point
     to the testing branch
    -when you make another commit after switching to a new branch, the master
     pointer stays where it is and HEAD and the branch pointer move forward
    -when switching branches, it's best practice to commit all your changes.
     this is because git won't let you switch branches if your working tree has
     uncommitted changes the conflict with the branch you're checking out
    -when there are conflicts, git will pause the merge.  run "git status" to see
     which files were not merged.  you'll have to manually change the file with
     issues.  to reslove the conflicts, add the file to the staging area. finally,
     commit to finalize the merge

-remote braches:
    -remote branches: references to the state of brances on your remote repositories.
     they are local branches that can't be moved.  instead, they're moved automatically
     when you do any network communication. remote branches act as bookmaks to
     remind you where the branches on your remote repositories were the last time
     you connected to them
    -<remote>/<branch>: this is the form of remote branches. for example, the "master"
     branch on the "origin" remote would be "origin/master"
    -when you clone a git repository from github, git automatically names it "orgin"
     and creates a pointer to the master branch named "origin/master" locally.
    -git also gives you your own master branch starting at the same place as
     "origin/master"
    -the "origin/master" pointer doesn't move as long as you stay out of contact
     with the github server
    -"git fetch origin": this command will sync your work with the server by fetching
     data from the server that you don't have and updates your local working
     directory.  this will also move "origin/master" to a new location. note,
     this does not merge any changes to "origin/master" and your local branches.
    -when your fetch brings down new branches, you don't automattically have local,
     editable copies of them.  you can either:
        -"git merge <remote/branch>" to merge the remote branch into your current
         working branch
        -"git checkout -b <local_branch> <remote/branch>": to create and checkout
         a new branch based on the remote branch.
    -the second method creates a "tracking" branch:
        -tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to
         a remote branch.  therefore, if you're on a tracking branch and you
         type "git push", git automattically knows which branch to push to.
        -running "git pull" on a "tracking" branch fetches all the remote references
         and automatically merges to the corresponding remote branch
        -after cloning a repository, a master branch is created that tracks
         origin/master, so "git push" and "git pull" automattically work
        -"git checkout --track <remote/branch>" will set up the branch you're on
         to track a remote branch
    -delete a remote branch with "git push <remote> :<branch>".
    -"git push <remote> <branch>": this will push a branch to the github server

-git homework workflow:
    "git checkout master"   # checkout the local master branch
    "git pull upstream master"   # fetch/merge class repository into local master
    "git push"   # push changes from class repository to personal repository
    [do work]
    "git commit -a"   # commit local changes
    [add a message]
    "git push"   # push local changes to personal repository

sequence types:

    -unicode strings

    -bytearrays
    -buffers
    -array.arrays
    -xrange objects (almost)

indexing:
    -items in a sequence my be looked up with an index using the subscription
     operator "[]"

slicing:
    -returning multiple elements of a sequence

indexing vs. slicing:
    -a slice always returns a sequence
    -slicing does not return an error when you're out of bounds in a sequence

membership:
    -you can use "in" or "not in"

similar features with sequences:
    -min()
    -max()
    -.index()
    -.count()
    -all support iteration

lists:
    -you can build lists with "list()" (e.g. list("salim"))
    -lists can contain all different object types
    -ways to make a list bigger
        -append() <-- adds a single item to the end
        -insert() <-- adds a single item
        -extend() <-- add multiple items to the end
    -shrinking the list
        -pop()
        -remove()
        -use "del" with a slice
    -misc methods:
        -.reverse()
        -.sort()
        -generally, methods that change a mutable object return None.  As opposed
         to methods on immuatble objects return a copy of the changed object.
    -list performance:
        -indexing is fast (i.e., Order 1)
        -x in s is slow (i.e., Order n)
        -looping is slow (i.e., Order n)
        -operating on the end of the list if fast (i.e., Order 1)
        -operating on the front or middle is slow (i.e., Order n)
            -this is because you need to move all the elements to the front
tuples:
    -you don't actually need the "(" and ")"; tuples rely on the commas
    -therefore a tuple with one element is (1,); i.e., you need the comma


lists vs. tuples
    -the difference between each is mutability
        -mutable: it can be changed in place
        -immutable: cannot be changed in place

immutable objects (that we know so far):
    -unicode
    -string
    -integer
    -float
    -tuple

mutable objects (that we know so far):
    -list

loops in python:
    -no indexing is required
    -you can use "enumerate()" if you want both the index and the elements of
     the object
    -to stop a loop early:
        -break: this stops and exits the loop
        -continue:  this moves the loop back to the start
    -loops can have an "else" statement
        -else executes when you didn't break out of the loop early
    -"while" loops
