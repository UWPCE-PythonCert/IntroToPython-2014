"""
Write a program that takes a filename and “cleans” the file by removing all the leading and trailing whitespace from each line.
    Read in the original file and write out a new one, either creating a new file or overwriting the existing one.
    Give your user the option of which to perform.
    Use map() to do the work.
    Write a second version using a comprehension.

    Use sys.argv to hold the command line arguments the user typed in.
    If the user types: $ python the_script a_file_name then:
        import sys
        filename = sys.argv[1]
        will get filename == "a_file_name"
