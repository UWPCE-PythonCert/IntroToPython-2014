What are the conventions of collections?

>> Lists are Collections (homogeneous)

How to know what to use:

>> Same operation to each element? 
> Use a list

>> Small collection of values which make a single logical input? 
> tuple

raw_input:

>> With raw_input() you always get a string back
>> if you want the input to come back as an integer use:
>> inp = raw_input("something")
>> int(inp)

Loops Control:

>> Break (just stop!)
>> and Continue

for i in range(101):
	print i
	if i > 50:

		break

	if i > 89

	# continure keyword will skip later statements in the loop block
	# but allow iteration to continue

		continue

>>Note: For loops can also take an optional else block
>> Executed only when the loop exits normally (not via break)
