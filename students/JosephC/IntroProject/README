This is the README file.  The Git book had it in their examples, so I figured i might as well include it in my project.  

TimeCrunch is for when you have no set exercise schedule and are looking for whatever way to get yourself in the habit of exercising.  TimeCrunch finds 
time your calendar schedule and pops up suggested workouts that fit that time.  It could be 30 seconds or 30 minutes.
