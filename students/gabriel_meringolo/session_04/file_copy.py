#write a program which copies a file from a source,
# to a destination (without using shutil, or the OS copy command)

#advanced: make it work for any size file: i.e. donâ€™t read the
# entire contents of the file into memory at once.

#Note that if you want it to do any kind of file,
# you need to open the files in binary mode: open(filename, 'rb') (or 'wb' for writing.)
