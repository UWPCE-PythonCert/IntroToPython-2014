Homework Questions?

My Solutions to all the exercises in the class repo in:

``Solutions/Session04``

A few tidbits ....

Sorting stuff in dictionaries:
-------------------------------

dicts aren't sorted, so what if you want to do something in a sorted way?

The "standard" way:

.. code-block:: python

  for key in sorted(d.keys()):
      ...

Other options:

.. code-block:: python

    collections.OrderedDict

Also other nifty stuff in the ``collections`` module:

https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/collections.html


PEP 8 reminder
--------------

PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8): https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Is the "official" style guide for Python code.

Strictly speaking, you only need to follow it for code in the standard library.

But style matters -- consistent style makes your code easier to read and understand.

So **follow PEP 8**

*Exception* -- if you have a company style guide follow that instead.

try the "pep8" module on your code::

  $ python3 -m pip install pep8
  $ pep8 my_python_file

(demo)

Naming things...
----------------

It matters what names you give your variables.

Python has rules about what it *allows*

PEP8 has rules for style: capitalization, and underscores and all that.

But you still get to decide within those rules.

So use names that make sense to the reader.

Naming Guidelines
-----------------

Only use single-letter names for things with limited scope: indexes and teh like:

.. code-block:: python

    for i, item in enumerate(a_sequence):
        do_something(i, item)

**Don't** use a name like "item", when there is a meaning to what the item is:

.. code-block:: python

    for name in all_the_names:
        do_something_with(name)

Use plurals for collections of things:

.. code-block:: python

    names = ['Fred', 'George', ...]

.. nextslide::

**Do** re-use names when the use is essentially the same, and you don't need the old one:

.. code-block:: python

    line = line.strip()
    line = line.replace(",", " ")
    ....

Here's a nice talk about naming:

==========
Exceptions
==========

Since there wasn't time last class...

Exceptions
----------

Another Branching structure:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        do_something()
        f = open('missing.txt')
        process(f)   # never called if file missing
    except IOError:
        print("couldn't open missing.txt")

Exceptions
----------
Never Do this:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        do_something()
        f = open('missing.txt')
        process(f)   # never called if file missing
    except:
        print "couldn't open missing.txt"


Exceptions
----------

Use Exceptions, rather than your own tests:

Don't do this:

.. code-block:: python

    do_something()
    if os.path.exists('missing.txt'):
        f = open('missing.txt')
        process(f)   # never called if file missing

It will almost always work -- but the almost will drive you crazy

.. nextslide::

Example from homework

.. code-block:: python

    if num_in.isdigit():
        num_in = int(num_in)

but -- ``int(num_in)`` will only work if the string can be converted to an integer.

So you can do

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        num_in = int(num_in)
    except ValueError:
        print("Input must be an integer, try again.")

Or let the Exception be raised....


.. nextslide:: EAFP


"it's Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission"

 -- Grace Hopper


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZDWveIdqjY

(PyCon talk by Alex Martelli)

.. nextslide:: Do you catch all Exceptions?

For simple scripts, let exceptions happen.

Only handle the exception if the code can and will do something about it.

(much better debugging info when an error does occur)


Exceptions -- finally
---------------------

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        do_something()
        f = open('missing.txt')
        process(f)   # never called if file missing
    except IOError:
        print("couldn't open missing.txt")
    finally:
        do_some_clean-up

The ``finally:``  clause will always run


Exceptions -- else
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        do_something()
        f = open('missing.txt')
    except IOError:
        print("couldn't open missing.txt")
    else:
        process(f) # only called if there was no exception

Advantage:

you know where the Exception came from

Exceptions -- using them
------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        do_something()
        f = open('missing.txt')
    except IOError as the_error:
        print(the_error)
        the_error.extra_info = "some more information"
        raise


Particularly useful if you catch more than one exception:

.. code-block:: python

    except (IOError, BufferError, OSError) as the_error:
        do_something_with (the_error)


Raising Exceptions
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

    def divide(a,b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("b can not be zero")
        else:
            return a / b


when you call it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [515]: divide (12,0)
    ZeroDivisionError: b can not be zero


Built in Exceptions
-------------------

You can create your own custom exceptions

But...

.. code-block:: python

    exp = \
     [name for name in dir(__builtin__) if "Error" in name]
    len(exp)
    32


For the most part, you can/should use a built in one

.. nextslide::

Choose the best match you can for the built in Exception you raise.

Example (from last week's exercises)::

  if (not isinstance(m, int)) or (not isinstance(n, int)):
      raise ValueError

Is it the *value* or the input the problem here?

Nope: the *type* is the problem::

  if (not isinstance(m, int)) or (not isinstance(n, int)):
      raise TypeError

but should you be checking type anyway? (EAFP)

=========================
Advanced Argument Passing
=========================

Keyword arguments
-----------------

When defining a function, you can specify only what you need -- in any order

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [151]: def fun(x,y=0,z=0):
            print(x,y,z)
       .....:
    In [152]: fun(1,2,3)
    1 2 3
    In [153]: fun(1, z=3)
    1 0 3
    In [154]: fun(1, z=3, y=2)
    1 2 3


.. nextslide::


A Common Idiom:

.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y=None):
        if y is None:
            do_something_different
        go_on_here



.. nextslide::

Can set defaults to variables

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [156]: y = 4
    In [157]: def fun(x=y):
        print("x is:", x)
       .....:
    In [158]: fun()
    x is: 4


.. nextslide::

Defaults are evaluated when the function is defined

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [156]: y = 4
    In [157]: def fun(x=y):
        print("x is:", x)
       .....:
    In [158]: fun()
    x is: 4
    In [159]: y = 6
    In [160]: fun()
    x is: 4


Function arguments in variables
-------------------------------

function arguments are really just

* a tuple (positional arguments)
* a dict (keyword arguments)

.. code-block:: python

    def f(x, y, w=0, h=0):
        print("position: {}, {} -- shape: {}, {}".format(x, y, w, h))

    position = (3,4)
    size = {'h': 10, 'w': 20}

    >>> f(*position, **size)
    position: 3, 4 -- shape: 20, 10



Function parameters in variables
--------------------------------

You can also pull the parameters out in the function as a tuple and a dict:

.. code-block:: ipython

    def f(*args, **kwargs):
        print("the positional arguments are:", args)
        print("the keyword arguments are:", kwargs)

    In [389]: f(2, 3, this=5, that=7)
    the positional arguments are: (2, 3)
    the keyword arguments are: {'this': 5, 'that': 7}

This can be very powerful...

Passing a dict to str.format()
-------------------------------

Now that you know that keyword args are really a dict,
you can do this nifty trick:

The string ``format()`` method takes keyword arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(last="Barker", first="Chris")
    Out[24]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

Build a dict of the keys and values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: d = {"last":"Barker", "first":"Chris"}

And pass to ``format()``with ``**``

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(**d)
    Out[26]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

=====================================
A bit more on mutability (and copies)
=====================================

mutable objects
----------------

We've talked about this: mutable objects can have their contents changed in place.

Immutable objects can not.

This has implications when you have a container with mutable objects in it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [28]: list1 = [ [1,2,3], ['a','b'] ]

one way to make a copy of a list:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [29]: list2 = list1[:]

    In [30]: list2 is list1
    Out[30]: False

they are different lists.

.. nextslide::

What if we set an element to a new value?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [31]: list1[0] = [5,6,7]

    In [32]: list1
    Out[32]: [[5, 6, 7], ['a', 'b']]

    In [33]: list2
    Out[33]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b']]

So they are independent.

.. nextslide::

But what if we mutate an element?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [34]: list1[1].append('c')

    In [35]: list1
    Out[35]: [[5, 6, 7], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [36]: list2
    Out[36]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

uuh oh! mutating an element in one list mutated the one in the other list.

.. nextslide::

Why is that?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [38]: list1[1] is list2[1]
    Out[38]: True

The elements are the same object!

This is known as a "shallow" copy -- Python doesn't want to copy more than it needs to, so in this case, it makes a new list, but does not make copies of the contents.

Same for dicts (and any container type -- even tuples!)

If the elements are immutable, it doesn't really make a differnce -- but be very careful with mutable elements.


The copy module
----------------

most objects have a way to make copies (``dict.copy()`` for instance).

but if not, you can use the ``copy`` module to make a copy:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [39]: import copy

    In [40]: list3 = copy.copy(list2)

    In [41]: list3
    Out[41]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

This is also a shallow copy.

.. nextslide::

But there is another option:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: list1
    Out[3]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [4]: list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1)

    In [5]: list1[0].append(4)

    In [6]: list1
    Out[6]: [[1, 2, 3, 4], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [7]: list2
    Out[7]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

``deepcopy`` recurses through the object, making copies of everything as it goes.

.. nextslide::


I happened on this thread on stack overflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3975376/understanding-dict-copy-shallow-or-deep

The OP is pretty confused -- can you sort it out?

Make sure you understand the difference between a reference, a shallow copy, and a deep copy.

Mutables as default arguments:
------------------------------

Another "gotcha" is using mutables as default arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: def fun(x, a=[]):
       ....:     a.append(x)
       ....:     print(a)
       ....:

This makes sense: maybe you'd pass in a specific list, but if not, the default is an empty list.

But:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: fun(3)
    [3]

    In [13]: fun(4)
    [3, 4]

Huh?!

.. nextslide::

Remember that that default argument is defined when the function is created: there will be only one list, and every time the function is called, that same list is used.


The solution:

The standard practice for such a mutable default argument:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [15]: def fun(x, a=None):
       ....:     if a is None:
       ....:         a = []
       ....:     a.append(x)
       ....:     print(a)
    In [16]: fun(3)
    [3]
    In [17]: fun(4)
    [4]

You get a new list every time the function is called

  keyword arguments:

* Write a function that has four optional parameters (with defaults):

  - fore_color
  - back_color
  - link_color
  - visited_color

* Have it print the colors (use strings for the colors)
* Call it with a couple different parameters set
* Have it pull the parameters out with ``*args, **kwargs``
  - and print those

============================
List and Dict Comprehensions
============================

List comprehensions
-------------------

A bit of functional programming

consider this common ``for`` loop structure:

.. code-block:: python

    new_list = []
    for variable in a_list:
        new_list.append(expression)

This can be expressed with a single line using a "list comprehension"

.. code-block:: python

    new_list = [expression for variable in a_list]


.. nextslide::

What about nested for loops?

.. code-block:: python

    new_list = []
    for var in a_list:
        for var2 in a_list2:
            new_list.append(expression)

Can also be expressed in one line:

.. code-block:: python

    new_list =  [exp for var in a_list for var2 in a_list2]

You get the "outer product", i.e. all combinations.

(demo)

.. nextslide::

But usually you at least have a conditional in the loop:

.. code-block:: python

    new_list = []
    for variable in a_list:
        if something_is_true:
            new_list.append(expression)

You can add a conditional to the comprehension:

.. code-block:: python

    new_list = [expr for var in a_list if something_is_true]


(demo)

.. nextslide::

Examples:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [341]: [x**2 for x in range(3)]
    Out[341]: [0, 1, 4]

    In [342]: [x+y for x in range(3) for y in range(5,7)]
    Out[342]: [5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8]

    In [343]: [x*2 for x in range(6) if not x%2]
    Out[343]: [0, 4, 8]



.. nextslide::

Remember this from earlier today?

.. code-block:: python

    [name for name in dir(__builtin__) if "Error" in name]
    ['ArithmeticError',
     'AssertionError',
     'AttributeError',
     'BufferError',
     'EOFError',
     ....


Set Comprehensions
------------------

You can do it with sets, too:

.. code-block:: python

    new_set = { value for variable in a_sequence }


same as for loop:

.. code-block:: python

    new_set = set()
    for key in a_list:
        new_set.add(value)


.. nextslide::

Example: finding all the vowels in a string...

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [19]: s = "a not very long string"

    In [20]: vowels = set('aeiou')

    In [21]: { l for l in s if l in vowels }
    Out[21]: {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o'}

Side note: why did I do ``set('aeiou')`` rather than just `aeiou` ?


Dict Comprehensions
-------------------

Also with dictionaries

.. code-block:: python

    new_dict = { key:value for variable in a_sequence}


same as for loop:

.. code-block:: python

    new_dict = {}
    for key in a_list:
        new_dict[key] = value



.. nextslide::

Example

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [22]: { i: "this_%i"%i for i in range(5) }
    Out[22]: {0: 'this_0', 1: 'this_1', 2: 'this_2',
              3: 'this_3', 4: 'this_4'}


(not as useful with the ``dict()``  constructor...)

=======
Testing
=======

.. rst-class:: build left
.. container::

    You've already seen some a very basic testing strategy.

    You've written some tests using that strategy.

    These tests were pretty basic, and a bit awkward in places (testing error
    conditions in particular).

    .. rst-class:: centered

    **It gets better**

Test Runners
------------

So far our tests have been limited to code in an ``if __name__ == "__main__":``
block.

.. rst-class:: build

* They are run only when the file is executed
* They are always run when the file is executed
* You can't do anything else when the file is executed without running tests.

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    This is not optimal.

    Python provides testing systems to help.


Standard Library: ``unittest``
-------------------------------

The original testing system in Python.

``import unittest``

More or less a port of ``Junit`` from Java

A bit verbose: you have to write classes & methods

(And we haven't covered that yet!)


Using ``unittest``
-------------------

You write subclasses of the ``unittest.TestCase`` class:

.. code-block:: python

    # in test.py
    import unittest

    class MyTests(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_tautology(self):
            self.assertEquals(1, 1)

Then you run the tests by using the ``main`` function from the ``unittest``
module:

.. code-block:: python

    # in test.py
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

.. nextslide:: Testing Your Code

This way, you can write your code in one file and test it from another:

.. code-block:: python

    # in my_mod.py
    def my_func(val1, val2):
        return val1 * val2

    # in test_my_mod.py
    import unittest
    from my_mod import my_func

    class MyFuncTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_my_func(self):
            test_vals = (2, 3)
            expected = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, test_vals)
            actual = my_func(*test_vals)
            self.assertEquals(expected, actual)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

.. nextslide:: Advantages of ``unittest``

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    The ``unittest`` module is pretty full featured

    It comes with the standard Python distribution, no installation required.

    It provides a wide variety of assertions for testing all sorts of situations.

    It allows for a setup and tear down workflow both before and after all tests and before and after each test.

    It's well known and well understood.

.. nextslide:: Disadvantages:

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::


    It's Object Oriented, and quite heavy.

      - modeled after Java's ``junit`` and it shows...

    It uses the framework design pattern, so knowing how to use the features
    means learning what to override.

    Needing to override means you have to be cautious.

    Test discovery is both inflexible and brittle.

    And there is no built-in parameterized testing.

Other Options
-------------

There are several other options for running tests in Python.

* `Nose`: https://nose.readthedocs.org/

* `pytest`: http://pytest.org/latest/

* ... (many frameworks supply their own test runners)

Both are very capable and widely used. I have a personal preference for pytest -- so we'll use it for this class

Installing ``pytest``
---------------------

The first step is to install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m pip install pytest

Once this is complete, you should have a ``py.test`` command you can run
at the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ py.test

If you have any tests in your repository, that will find and run them.

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    **Do you?**

Pre-existing Tests
------------------

Let's take a look at some examples.

``IntroToPython\Examples\Session05``

`` $ py.test``

You can also run py.test on a particular test file:

``py.test test_this.py``

The results you should have seen when you ran ``py.test`` above come
partly from these files.

Let's take a few minutes to look these files over.

[demo]

.. nextslide:: What's Happening Here.

When you run the ``py.test`` command, ``pytest`` starts in your current
working directory and searches the filesystem for things that might be tests.

It follows some simple rules:

.. rst-class:: build

* Any python file that starts with ``test_`` or ``_test`` is imported.
* Any functions in them that start with ``test_`` are run as tests.
* Any classes that start with ``Test`` are treated similarly, with methods that begin with ``test_`` treated as tests.


.. nextslide:: pytest

This test running framework is simple, flexible and configurable.

`Read the documentation`_ for more information.

.. _Read the documentation: http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html#getstarted

.. nextslide:: Test Driven Development

What we've just done here is the first step in what is called **Test Driven
Development**.

A bunch of tests exist, but the code to make them pass does not yet exist.

The red you see in the terminal when we run our tests is a goad to us to write
the code that fixes these tests.

Let's do that next!

===
LAB
===

Pick an example from codingbat:

``http://codingbat.com``

Do a bit of test-driven development on it:

 * run something on the web site.
 * write a few tests using the examples from the site.
 * then write the function, and fix it 'till it passes the tests.

Do at least two of these...
