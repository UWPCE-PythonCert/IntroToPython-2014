Shell Customizations for Python Development
*******************************************

The command line is your home as a developer.  You must be comfortable there.
In order to improve your comfort there are a number of enhancements you can
make to improve your experience, especially with non-standard software like
``git`` and ``virtualenv``

What was that name, again?
==========================

For example, ``bash`` offers tab completion. But that doesn't extend to
interactions with ``git``. Considering how many branches, tags and remotes you
end up interacting with, and how many long-winded commands there are in
``git``, having a similar autocompletion for them would be very nice.

The folks who create such things have been kind enough to provide a shell
script that sets this up. And it's not hard to install.

`The script`_ is called ``git-completion`` and it's available in ``bash``,
``tcsh`` and ``zsh`` flavors.

.. _The script: https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion

To use it, download the version of the script that corresponds to your
preferred shell from the tag of the git repo that corresponds to the version of
git you are using. I've got git 1.8.4.2 installed on my machine, so
`this is the version for me`_. Put it in your home directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd
    $ curl https://raw.github.com/git/git/v1.8.4.2/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o .git-completion.bash

Then source it from your shell startup file:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/.git-completion.bash

There's even a nifty gist that `does this automatically`_ for OS X.

.. _this is the version for me: https://raw.github.com/git/git/v1.8.4.2/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
.. _does this automatically: https://gist.github.com/johngibb/972430

Once installed, you should be able to visit any repository you have on your
machine and get tab completion of branch names, remotes and all git commands.

Where am I, what am I doing?
============================

As a working developer, you end up with a *lot* of projects. Even with tab
completion its a chore to remember which branch is checked out, how far ahead
or behind the remote you are, and so on.

Enter `git-prompt`_. Again, you place this code in your home directory, and
then source it from your shell startup file:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/.git-prompt.sh

Once you do this you can use the ``__git_ps1`` shell command and a number of
shell variables to configure ``PS1`` and change your shell prompt. You can show
the name of the current branch of a repository when you are in one. You can
get information about the status of HEAD, modified files, stashes, untracked
files and more.

.. _git-prompt: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh

There's two ways to do this.  The first is to use ``__git_ps1`` as a command
directly in a ``PS1`` expression in your shell startup file:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '

The result looks like this:

    :width: 600px
    :alt: Overriding PS1 provides a customized shell prompt


That's not bad, but a bit of color would be nice, and perhaps breaking things
onto more than one line so you can parse what you're seeing more easily would
be helpful.

For that, you'll need to change strategies.  The ``__git_ps1`` command can be
used as a single element in the expression for ``PS1``.  But it can also be
used itself as the ``PROMPT_COMMAND`` env variable (this command is for
``bash``, there's different one for ``zsh``). If defined, this command will be
used to form ``PS1`` dynamically.

When you use ``__git_ps1`` in this way, a couple of things happen.  First,
instead of taking only one optional argument (a format string), you can provide
two or optionally three arguments:

* The first will be prepended to the output of the command
* The second will be appended after
* The optional third argumment will be used as a format string for the output
  of the command itself. If there is no output, it will not appear at all.

Combining these three elements can be very expressive. For example, A standard
OS X command prompt can be expressed like so: ``\h:\W \u\\\$ ``. If you use this
expression as the second argument, leave the first empty and provide a simple format
ending in a newline for the ``__git_ps1`` output, you get some nice results.

Enter this in your shell startup file:

.. code-block:: bash

    PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "" "\h:\W \u\\\$ " "[%s]\n"'

That produces a nice two-line prompt that appears when you're in a git repo, and
disappears when you're not:

.. image:: /_static/two_line_prompt.png
    :width: 600px
    :alt: A two-line prompt showing current git repository

You can also play with setting a few environment variables in your shell
startup file to expand this further. For example, colorizing the output and
providing information about the state of a repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
    GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS=1
    GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=1
    GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto"
    PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "" "\h:\W \u\\\$ " "[%s]\n"'

.. image:: /_static/color_git_prompt.png
    :width: 600px
    :alt: A colorized git prompt

Not half bad at all.

But wait, there's more.
=======================

The problem with this is that it doesn't play well with another incredibly
useful tool, `virtualenv`_. When you activate a virtualenv, it prepends the name
of the environment you are working on to the shell prompt.

But it uses the standard ``PS1`` shell variable to do this. Since you've now
used the ``PROMPT_COMMAND`` to create your prompt, ``PS1`` is ignored, and
this nice feature of virtualenv is lost.

.. _virtualenv: http://virtualenv.org

Luckily, there is a way out. Bash shell scripting offers `parameter expansion`_
and a trick of the that syntax can help. Normally, a shell parameter is
referenced like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ PARAM='foobar'
    $ echo $PARAM
    foobar

In complicated situations, you can wrap the name of the paramter in curly
braces to avoid confusion with following characters:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo ${PARAM}andthennotparam
    foobarandthennotparam

What is not as well known is that this curly-brace syntax has a lot of
interesting variations. For example, you can use ``PARAM`` as a test and
actually print something else entirely:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo ${PARAM:+'foo'}
    foo
    $ echo ${PARAM:+'bar'}

    $

The key here is the ``:<char>`` bit immediately after ``PARAM``. If the ``+``
char is present, then if ``PARAM`` is unset or null, what comes after is not
printed, otherwise it is.

If you look at the script that `activates a virtualenv in bash`_ you'll notice
that it exports ``VIRTUAL_ENV``. This means that so long as a virtualenv is
active, this environmental variable will be set. And it will be unset when no
environment is active.

.. _parameter expansion: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion
.. _activates a virtualenv in bash: https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/blob/develop/virtualenv_embedded/activate.sh

You can use that!

Armed with this knowledge, you can construct a shell expression that will either
print the name of the active virtualenv in square brackets, or print nothing if
no virtualenv was active:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo ${VIRTUAL_ENV:+[`basename $VIRTUAL_ENV`]}

    $ source /path/to/someenv/bin/activate
    $ echo ${VIRTUAL_ENV:+[`basename $VIRTUAL_ENV`]}
    someenv


Roll that into your shell startup file. You'll have everything you want.  You
can even throw in a little more color for good measure:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/.git-prompt.sh
    # PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
    GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
    GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS=1
    GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=1
    GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto"
    Color_Off="\[\033[0m\]"
    Yellow="\[\033[0;33m\]"
    PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "${VIRTUAL_ENV:+[$Yellow`basename $VIRTUAL_ENV`$Color_Off]\n}" "\h:\W \u\\\$ " "[%s]\n"'

And voil√†! You've got a shell prompt that informs about all the things you'll
need to know when working on a daily basis:

    :width: 600px

Wrap-Up
=======

There is still a great deal more that you could do with your shell, but this
will suffice for now. If you are interested in reading further, there is
`a lot to learn`_.
