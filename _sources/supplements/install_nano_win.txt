	For all Windows installations, download the WinNT/9x binary from here: 

	http://www.nano-editor.org/download.php

	Unzip the file and move the files into the git bin directory: C:\Program Files\Git\bin

	That's it! You should now be able to use nano from git bash:

	.. code-block:: bash
	
		$ nano test.txt

	Command shortcuts are helpfully written in the editor!
