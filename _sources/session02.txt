==============================

Let's get to know git a bit


Why Version Control?
--------------------

   "Piled Higher and Deeper" by Jorge Cham

What is git?
------------
.. rst-class:: build

.. container::

    A "version control system"

    A history of everything everyone does to 'your' code

    A graph of "states" in which the code has existed

    That last one is a bit tricky, and is not necessary to understand right out of the gate. When you are ready, you can look at this supplement to gain a better understanding:

    :ref:`supplement_git_states`

Setting up git
--------------

You should have git installed on your machine and accessible from the command line. There will be a little bit of setup for git that you should only have to do once.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git config --global user.name "Marie Curie"
    $ git config --global user.email "marie@radioactive.com"

Editor
------

You will never have to use an editor with git for anything extensive, so a simple editor is fine. Unfortunately, the default, VI, is not intuitive to new users. So, let's set up a different editor, before you find yourself accidentally stuck in VI land.
Nano is a very straight-forward, simple editor, available without installing anything on Macs and Linux boxes, but needs to be installed on Windows (or you can use sublime or Notepad++ as shown below). To install nano on Windows: :ref:`supplement_install_nano_win`

nano
``$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"``

sublime (mac)
``$ git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"``

sublime (win)
``$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 2/sublime_text.exe' -w"``

Notepad++ (Win)
``$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"``

Repositories
------------

A repository is just a collection of files that 'belong together'.

Since ``git`` is a *distributed* versioning system, there is no **central**
repository that serves as the one to rule them all. This simply means that all repositories should look the same.

However, to keep things sane, there is generally one repository chosen that users check with for changes, for us this is GitHub.


Working with Remotes
--------------------

With git, you work with *local* repositories and *remotes* that they are connected to.

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    Git uses shortcuts to address *remotes*. Cloned repositories get an *origin* shortcut for free:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git remote -v
        origin  https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/IntroToPython.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/IntroToPython.git (push)

    This shows that the local repo on my machine *originated* from the one in
    the UWPCE-PythonCert gitHub account (don't worry that it shows it twice, they should be the same)

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    You can work on any project you wish to that has a public repository on Github. However, since you won't have permission to edit most projects directly, there is such a thing as *forking* a project.

    When you *fork* a repository, you make a copy of that repository in your own (Github) account.

    When you have made changes that you believe the rest of the community will want to adopt, you make a *pull request* to the original project. The maintainer(s) of that project than have the option of accepting your changes, in which case your changes will become part of that project.

    This is how we will be working in this class. When you want feedback on your work, you will make a *pull request* to the instructors.

.. nextslide::

Our class materials reside in a repository on *Github* in the *UWPCE-PythonCert* organization:

.. figure:: /_static/remotes_start.png
    :width: 50%
    :class: center

.. nextslide::

We will now create a fork of the class repository from the ``UWPCE-PythonCert``
account on GitHub into your personal account:

.. figure:: /_static/remotes_fork.png
    :width: 50%
    :class: center

.. nextslide::

The next step is to make a *clone* of your fork on your own computer, which means that
**your fork** in github is the *origin*:

.. figure:: /_static/remotes_clone.png
    :width: 50%
    :class: center

.. nextslide::

We will now set up our individual folders and include a README in this folder. In your terminal, cd
into the students directory in the directory created when we made the clone, which may or may not be called IntroPython2015.

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd IntroPython2015/students
        $ git status

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git pull origin master

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ mkdir maria_mckinley

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd maria_mckinley

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ echo "# Python code for UWPCE-PythonCert class" >> README.rst

.. nextslide::

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    Check the status

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git status

    Add anything you want to commit to your commit:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git add README.rst

    Make your commit:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git commit -m 'added a readme file'

    Push your changes:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git push origin master

    Go onto GitHub, and make a pull request!

.. nextslide::

You've pushed your own changes to that fork, and then issued pull requests to have that worked merged back to the ``UWPCE-PythonCert`` original.

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    You want to keep your fork up-to-date with that original copy as the class
    goes forward.

    To do this, you add a new *remote* repository to your local clone.

.. nextslide:: Adding a Remote

You can add *remotes* at will, to connect your *local* repository to other
copies of it in different remote locations.

When you add a *remote* (existing git repository), it creates a directory with the name of the repository at the top level.

.. rst-class:: build
.. container::

    This allows you to grab changes made to the repository in these other
    locations.

    For our class, we will add an *upstream* remote to our local copy that points
    to the original copy of the material in the ``UWPCE-PythonCert`` account.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/IntroToPython.git

        $ git remote -v
        origin  https://github.com/PythonCHB/IntroToPython.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/PythonCHB/IntroToPython.git (push)
        upstream    https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/IntroToPython.git (fetch)
        upstream    https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/IntroToPython.git (push)

.. nextslide::

This should leave you in a situation that looks like this:

.. figure:: /_static/remotes_upstream.png
    :width: 50%
    :class: center


.. nextslide:: Fetching Everything.

To get the updates from your new remote, you'll need first to fetch everything:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git fetch --all
    Fetching origin
    Fetching upstream
    ...

Then you can see the branches you have locally available:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git branch -a
  * master
    remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
    remotes/origin/master
    remotes/upstream/master

.. nextslide:: Fetching Upstream Changes

Finally, you can fetch and then merge changes from the upstream master.

Start by making sure you are on your own master branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout master

This is **really really** important.  Take the time to ensure you are where you
think you are.

.. nextslide:: Merging Upstream Changes

Then, fetch the upstream master branch and merge it into your master:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git fetch upstream master
  From https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/IntroToPython
   * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

  $ git merge upstream/master
  Updating 3239de7..9ddbdbb
  Fast-forward
   Examples/README.rst              |  4 ++++
  ...
   create mode 100644 Examples/README.rst
  ...

NOTE: you can do that in one step with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git pull upstream master

.. nextslide:: Pushing to Origin

Now all the changes from *upstream* are present in your local clone.

In order to preserve them in your fork on GitHub, you'll have to push:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 10 commits.
      (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    $ git push origin master
    Counting objects: 44, done.
    ...
    $

(A simple ``git push`` will usually do the right thing)

.. nextslide:: Daily Workflow

You can incorporate this into your daily workflow: ::

    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull upstream master
    $ git push
    [do some work]
    $ git commit -a
    [add a good commit message]
    $ git push
    [make a pull request]


LAB: Grid Printer
=================

.. rst-class:: left

    With only the ability to do a bit with numbers and text, you should be
    able to do this little project:

    :ref:`exercise_grid_printer`

Getting Started:
----------------

Lets use git and gitHub to manage this project:

Start by putting a python file in your clone of the class gitHub project:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd my_personal_directory
  $ mkdir session_01
  $ cd session_01
  $ touch grid_printer.py
  $ git add grid_printer.py

Then put your code in grid_printer.py

Committing your code
--------------------

When it does something useful, you can commit it.

First check the status:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git status

If it's what you expect, you can push:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git commit -a -m "first version"

And when you want us to take a look, push it to gitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git push

Then you can go to gitHub and do a "Pull Request"

Beyond Printing
================

.. rst-class:: center medium

Because there's a few things you just gotta have

Basics
------

You really can't really do much at all without at least
conditionals, looping, and a container type...


Making a Decision
------------------

**"Conditionals"**

``if`` and ``elif`` (else if) allow you to make decisions:

.. code-block:: python

    if a:
        print 'a'
    elif b:
        print 'b'
    elif c:
        print 'c'
    else:
        print 'that was unexpected'


.. nextslide:: if

What's the difference between these two?

.. code-block:: python

    if a:
        print 'a'
    elif b:
        print 'b'

    ## versus...
    if a:
        print 'a'
    if b:
        print 'b'



Lists
-----

A way to store a bunch of stuff in order

Pretty much like an "array" or "vector" in other languages

.. code-block:: python

    a_list = [2,3,5,9]
    a_list_of_strings = ['this', 'that', 'the', 'other']

You can put any type of object in a list...

Tuples
-------

Another way to store an ordered list of things

.. code-block:: python

    a_tuple = (2,3,4,5)
    a_tuple_of_strings = ('this', 'that', 'the', 'other')

You can also put any type of object in a tuple...
(sense a theme here?)

Tuples are **not** the same as lists.

The exact difference is a topic for next session.


``for`` loops
--------------

Sometimes called a 'determinate' loop

When you need to do something to all the objects in a sequence

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [10]: a_list = [2,3,4,5]

    In [11]: for item in a_list:
       ....:     print(item)
       ....:
    2
    3
    4
    5


.. nextslide:: ``range()`` and for

``range`` builds sequences of numbers automatically

Use it when you need to do something a set number of times

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [31]: for i in range(4):
        print('*', end=' ')
       ....:
    * * * *


NOTE: ``range(n)`` creates an "iterable" -- something you can loop over
-- more on that later.

Intricacies
------------

This is enough to get you started.

Each of these have intricacies special to python

We'll get to those over the next couple of classes


LAB: Fizz Buzz
===============

.. rst-class:: left

    We now have the tools to do a implementation of the classic "Fizz Buzz" problem:

    :ref:`exercise_fizz_buzz`

    Do the same git / gitHub dance with this, too!

More on Functions
=================

Variable scope
--------------

Defining a function:

.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y):
        z = x + y
        return z

x, y, z are *local* names


Local vs. Global
----------------

Names bound in Python have a *scope*

That *scope* determines where a symbol is visible, or what value it has in a
given block.

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [14]: x = 32
    In [15]: y = 33
    In [16]: z = 34
    In [17]: def fun(y, z):
       ....:     print(x, y, z)
       ....:
    In [18]: fun(3, 4)
    32 3 4


x is global, y and z local to the function

.. nextslide::

But, did the value of y and z change in the *global* scope?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [19]: y
    Out[19]: 33

    In [20]: z
    Out[20]: 34

.. nextslide::

In general, you should use global bindings mostly for constants.

The python convention is to designate global constants by typing the
symbols we bind to them in ALL_CAPS

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [u'foo', u'bar', u'baz']
    CONFIGURATION_KEY = u'some secret value'
    ...

This is just a convention, but it's a good one to follow.


Global Gotcha
--------------

Take a look at this function definition:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [21]: x = 3

    In [22]: def f():
       ....:     y = x
       ....:     x = 5
       ....:     print(x)
       ....:     print(y)
       ....:

What is going to happen when we call ``f``

.. nextslide:: Global Gotcha

Try it and see:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [34]: f()
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    UnboundLocalError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-34-0ec059b9bfe1> in <module>()
    ----> 1 f()

    <ipython-input-33-4363b2b69f73> in f()
          1 def f():
    ----> 2     y = x
          3     x = 5
          4     print(x)
          5     print(y)

    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment

Because you are binding the symbol ``x`` locally, it becomes a local and masks
the global value already bound.


Parameters
----------

So far we've seen simple parameter lists:

.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y, z):
        print(x, y, z)

These types of parameters are called *positional*

When you call a function, you **must** provide arguments for all *positional*
parameters *in the order they are listed*


.. nextslide::

You can provide *default values* for parameters in a function definition:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: def fun(x=1, y=2, z=3):
       ....:     print(x, y, z)
       ....:

When parameters are given with default values, they become *optional*

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: fun()
    1 2 3


.. nextslide::

You can provide arguments to a function call for *optional* parameters
positionally:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: fun(6)
    6 2 3
    In [27]: fun(6, 7)
    6 7 3
    In [28]: fun(6, 7, 8)
    6 7 8

Or, you can use the parameter name as a *keyword* to indicate which you mean:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [29]: fun(y=4, x=1)
    1 4 3

.. nextslide::

Once you've provided a *keyword* argument in this way, you can no longer
provide any *positional* arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [30]: fun(x=5, 6)
      File "<ipython-input-30-4529e5befb95>", line 1
        fun(x=5, 6)
    SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg


Documentation
-------------

It's often helpful to leave information in your code about what you were
thinking when you wrote it.

This can help reduce the number of `WTFs per minute`_ in reading it later.

.. _WTFs per minute: http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m

There are two approaches to this:

* Comments
* Docstrings

.. nextslide:: Comments

Comments go inline in the body of your code, to explain reasoning:

.. code-block:: python

    if (frobnaglers > whozits):
        # borangas are shermed to ensure frobnagler population
        # does not grow out of control
        sherm_the_boranga()

You can use them to mark places you want to revisit later:

.. code-block:: python

    for partygoer in partygoers:
        for balloon in balloons:
            for cupcake in cupcakes:
                # TODO: Reduce time complexity here.  It's killing us
                #  for large parties.
                resolve_party_favor(partygoer, balloon, cupcake)

.. nextslide:: Comments

Be judicious in your use of comments.

Use them when you need to.

Make them useful.

This is not useful:

.. code-block:: python

    for sponge in sponges:
        # apply soap to each sponge
        worker.apply_soap(sponge)

Note: Nothing special about Python here -- basic good programing practice.

Docstrings
----------

In Python, ``docstrings`` are used to provide in-line documentation in a number of places.

The first place we will see is in the definition of ``functions``.

To define a function you use the ``def`` keyword.

If a ``string literal`` is the first thing in the function block following the
header, it is a ``docstring``:

.. code-block:: python

    def complex_function(arg1, arg2, kwarg1=u'bannana'):
        """Return a value resulting from a complex calculation."""
        # code block here

You can then read this in an interpreter as the ``__doc__`` attribute of the
function object.

.. nextslide::

A ``docstring`` should:


* Be a complete sentence in the form of a command describing what the function
  does.

  * """Return a list of values based on blah blah""" is a good docstring
  * """Returns a list of values based on blah blah""" is *not*

* Have a useful single line.

  * If more description is needed, make the first line a complete sentence and
    add more lines below for enhancement.

* Be enclosed with triple-quotes.

  * This allows for easy expansion if required at a later date
  * Always close on the same line if the docstring is only one line.

For more information see `PEP 257: Docstring Conventions`_.

.. _PEP 257\: Docstring Conventions: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/


Recursion
---------

You've seen functions that call other functions.

If a function calls *itself*, we call that **recursion**

Like with other functions, a call within a call establishes a *call stack*

With recursion, if you are not careful, this stack can get *very* deep.

Python has a maximum limit to how much it can recurse. This is intended to
save your machine from running out of RAM.

.. nextslide:: Recursion can be Useful

Recursion is especially useful for a particular set of problems.

For example, take the case of the *factorial* function.

In mathematics, the *factorial* of an integer is the result of multiplying that
integer by every integer smaller than it down to 1.

::

    5! == 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

We can use a recursive function nicely to model this mathematical function

.. ifslides::

    .. rst-class:: centered

    [demo]

``assert``
----------

Writing ``tests`` that demonstrate that your program works is an important part of learning to program.

The python ``assert`` statement is useful in writing simple tests
for your code.

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: def add(n1, n2):
       ...:     return n1 + n2
       ...:

    In [2]: assert add(3, 4) == 7

    In [3]: assert add(3, 4) == 10

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    AssertionError                     Traceback (most recent call last)

Boolean Expressions
===================

Truthiness
----------

What is true or false in Python?

* The Booleans: ``True``  and ``False``

* "Something or Nothing"

*  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-April/022107.html


.. nextslide::

Determining Truthiness:

.. code-block:: python

    bool(something)


What is False?
--------------

* ``None``

* ``False``

* **Nothing:**

    - Zero of any numeric type: ``0, 0L, 0.0, 0j``.
    - Any empty sequence, for example, ``"", (), []``.
    - Any empty mapping, for example, ``{}`` .
    - Instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a ``__nonzero__()`` or ``__len__()`` method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value ``False``.

* http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html

What is True?
-------------

.. rst-class:: center large

Everything Else


Pythonic Booleans
-----------------

Any object in Python, when passed to the ``bool()`` type object, will
evaluate to ``True`` or ``False``.

When you use the ``if`` keyword, it automatically does this to the expression provided.

Which means that this is redundant, and not Pythonic:

.. code-block:: python

    if xx == True:
        do_something()
    # or even worse:
    if bool(xx) == True:
        do_something()

Instead, use what Python gives you:

.. code-block:: python

    if xx:
        do_something()


``and``, ``or`` and ``not``
---------------------------

Python has three boolean keywords, ``and``, ``or`` and ``not``.

``and`` and ``or`` are binary expressions, and evaluate from left to right.

``and`` will return the first operand that evaluates to False, or the last
operand if none are True:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [35]: 0 and 456
    Out[35]: 0

``or`` will return the first operand that evaluates to True, or the last
operand if none are True:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [36]: 0 or 456
    Out[36]: 456

.. nextslide::

On the other hand, ``not`` is a unary expression and inverts the boolean value
of its operand:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [39]: not True
    Out[39]: False

    In [40]: not False
    Out[40]: True

.. nextslide:: Shortcutting

Because of the return value of these keywords, you can write concise
statements:

::

                      if x is false,
    x or y               return y,
                         else return x

                      if x is false,
    x and y              return  x
                         else return y

                      if x is false,
    not x                return True,
                         else return False

The first value that defines the result is returned

Ternary Expressions
-------------------

This is a fairly common idiom:

.. code-block:: python

    if something:
        x = a_value
    else:
        x = another_value

In other languages, this can be compressed with a "ternary operator"::

    result = a > b ? x : y;

In python, the same is accomplished with the ternary expression:

.. code-block:: python

    y = 5 if x > 2 else 3

PEP 308:
(http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/)


Boolean Return Values
---------------------

Remember this puzzle from the CodingBat exercises?

.. code-block:: python

    def sleep_in(weekday, vacation):
        if weekday == True and vacation == False:
            return False
        else:
            return True

Though correct, that's not a particularly Pythonic way of solving the problem.

Here's a better solution:

.. code-block:: python

    def sleep_in(weekday, vacation):
        return not (weekday == True and vacation == False)


.. nextslide::

And here's an even better one:

.. code-block:: python

    def sleep_in(weekday, vacation):
        return (not weekday) or vacation


.. nextslide:: bools are integers?

In python, the boolean types are subclasses of integer:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: True == 1
    Out[1]: True
    In [2]: False == 0
    Out[2]: True


And you can even do math with them (though it's a bit odd to do so):

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: 3 + True
    Out[6]: 4

.. ifslides::

    .. rst-class:: center

    (demo)


LAB: Booleans
=============

.. rst-class:: left

    Working with Booleans, Ternary Expressions, etc:

    Re-write a couple CodingBat exercises, returning the direct boolean results, and/or using ternary expressions.

    Experiment with ``locals`` by adding this statement one of the functions you wrote today::

        print locals()


Code Structure, Modules, and Namespaces
=======================================

.. rst-class:: center large

How to get what you want when you want it.


Code Structure
--------------

In Python, the structure of your code is determined by whitespace.

How you *indent* your code determines how it is structured

::

    block statement:
        some code body
        some more code body
        another block statement:
            code body in
            that block

The colon that terminates a block statement is also important...

.. nextslide:: One-liners

You can put a one-liner after the colon:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [167]: x = 12
    In [168]: if x > 4: print x
    12

But this should only be done if it makes your code **more** readable.


.. nextslide:: Spaces vs. Tabs

Whitespace is important in Python.

An indent *could* be:

* Any number of spaces
* A tab
* A mix of tabs and spaces:

If you want anyone to take you seriously as a Python developer:

.. rst-class:: centered

**Always use four spaces -- really!**

`(PEP 8)`_

.. _(PEP 8): http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


.. nextslide:: Spaces Elsewhere

Other than indenting -- space doesn't matter, technically.

.. code-block:: python

    x = 3*4+12/func(x,y,z)
    x = 3*4 + 12 /   func (x,   y, z)

But you should strive for proper style.  Read `PEP 8`_ and install a linter in
your editor.

.. _PEP 8: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


Modules and Packages
--------------------

Python is all about *namespaces* --  the "dots"

``name.another_name``

The "dot" indicates that you are looking for a name in the *namespace* of the
given object. It could be:

* name in a module
* module in a package
* attribute of an object
* method of an object


.. nextslide:: Modules

A module is simply a namespace.

It might be a single file, or it could be a collection of files that define a
shared API.

To a first approximation, you can think of the files you write that end in
``.py`` as modules.

.. nextslide:: Packages

A package is a module with other modules in it.

On a filesystem, this is represented as a directory that contains one or more
``.py`` files, one of which **must** be called ``__init__.py``.

When you have a package, you can import the package, or any of the modules
inside it.

.. nextslide:: importing modules

.. code-block:: python

    import modulename
    from modulename import this, that
    import modulename as a_new_name
    from modulename import this as that

.. ifslides::

    .. rst-class:: centered

    (demo)


importing from packages
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import packagename.modulename
    from packagename.modulename import this, that
    from package import modulename

.. ifslides::

    .. rst-class:: centered

    (demo)

http://effbot.org/zone/import-confusion.htm

.. nextslide::

.. code-block:: python

    from modulename import *

.. rst-class:: centered large

**Don't do this!**


``import``
----------

When you import a module, or a symbol from a module, the Python code is
*compiled* to **bytecode**.

The result is a ``module.pyc`` file.

Then after compiling, all the code in the module is run **at the module scope**.

For this reason, it is good to avoid module-scope statements that have global
side-effects.


Re-import
----------

The code in a module is NOT re-run when imported again

It must be explicitly reloaded to be re-run

.. code-block:: python

    import modulename
    reload(modulename)

.. ifslides::

    .. rst-class:: centered

    (demo)


.. nextslide:: Running a Module

In addition to importing modules, you can run them.

There are a few ways to do this:

.. rst-class:: build

* ``$ python hello.py``   -- must be in current working directory
* ``$ python -m hello``   -- any module on PYTHONPATH anywhere on the system
* ``$ ./hello.py``        -- put ``#!/usr/env/python``  at top of module (Unix)
* ``In [149]: run hello.py``     -- at the IPython prompt -- running a module brings its names into the interactive namespace


.. nextslide:: Running a Module

Like importing, running a module executes all statements at the module level.

But there's an important difference.

When you *import* a module, the value of the symbol ``__name__`` in the module
is the same as the filename.

When you *run* a module, the value of the symbol ``__name__`` is ``__main__``.

This allows you to create blocks of code that are executed *only when you run a module*

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Do something interesting here
        # It will only happen when the module is run

.. nextslide:: "main" blocks

This is useful in a number of cases.

You can put code here that lets your module be a utility *script*

You can put code here that demonstrates the functions contained in your module

You can put code here that proves that your module works.

Import Interactions
-------------------

Let's experiment with importing different ways:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: import math

    In [4]: math.<TAB>
    math.acos       math.degrees    math.fsum       math.pi
    math.acosh      math.e          math.gamma      math.pow
    math.asin       math.erf        math.hypot      math.radians
    math.asinh      math.erfc       math.isinf      math.sin
    math.atan       math.exp        math.isnan      math.sinh
    math.atan2      math.expm1      math.ldexp      math.sqrt
    math.atanh      math.fabs       math.lgamma     math.tan
    math.ceil       math.factorial  math.log        math.tanh
    math.copysign   math.floor      math.log10      math.trunc
    math.cos        math.fmod       math.log1p
    math.cosh       math.frexp      math.modf

.. nextslide::

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: math.sqrt(4)
    Out[6]: 2.0
    In [7]: import math as m
    In [8]: m.sqrt(4)
    Out[8]: 2.0
    In [9]: from math import sqrt
    In [10]: sqrt(4)
    Out[10]: 2.0


.. nextslide::

Experiment with importing different ways:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    print sys.path
    import os
    print os.path

You wouldn't want to import * those!

  -- check out

.. code-block:: python

    os.path.split('/foo/bar/baz.txt')
    os.path.join('/foo/bar', 'baz.txt')
