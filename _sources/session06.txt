Notes from Homework:
--------------------

Comparing to "singletons":

Use:

``if something is None``

Not:

``if something == None``

(also ``True`` and ``False``)

rich comparisons: numpy

(demo)

.. nextslide::

Binary mode for files:

.. code-block:: python

    infile = open(infilename, 'rb')
    outfile = open(outfilename, 'wb')

|

You don't actually need to use the result of a list comp:

.. code-block:: python

    for i, st in zip( divisors, sets):
        [ st.add(j) for j in range(21) if not j%i ]

.. nextslide::

Apropos of today's topics:

Python functions are objects, so if you dont call them, you do'nt get an error, you jsut get the function object, ususally not what you want::

        elif donor_name.lower == "exit":

this is comparing the string ``lower`` method to the string "exit" and theyare never going to be equal!

That should be::

    elif donor_name.lower() == "exit":

This is actually a pretty common typo -- keep an eye out for it when you get strange errors, or something just doesn't seem to be getting triggered.

=========================
Advanced Argument Passing
=========================

This is a very, very nift Python feature -- it really lets you write dynamic programs.

Keyword arguments
-----------------

When defining a function, you can specify only what you need -- in any order

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [151]: def fun(x=0, y=0, z=0):
            print(x,y,z)
       .....:
    In [152]: fun(1,2,3)
    1 2 3
    In [153]: fun(1, z=3)
    1 0 3
    In [154]: fun(z=3, y=2)
    0 2 3


.. nextslide::


A Common Idiom:

.. code-block:: python

    def fun(x, y=None):
        if y is None:
            do_something_different
        go_on_here


.. nextslide::

Can set defaults to variables

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [156]: y = 4
    In [157]: def fun(x=y):
        print("x is:", x)
       .....:
    In [158]: fun()
    x is: 4


.. nextslide::

Defaults are evaluated when the function is defined

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [156]: y = 4
    In [157]: def fun(x=y):
        print("x is:", x)
       .....:
    In [158]: fun()
    x is: 4
    In [159]: y = 6
    In [160]: fun()
    x is: 4

This is a **very** important point -- I will repeat it!


Function arguments in variables
-------------------------------

function arguments are really just

* a tuple (positional arguments)
* a dict (keyword arguments)

.. code-block:: python

    def f(x, y, w=0, h=0):
        print("position: {}, {} -- shape: {}, {}".format(x, y, w, h))

    position = (3,4)
    size = {'h': 10, 'w': 20}

    >>> f(*position, **size)
    position: 3, 4 -- shape: 20, 10


Function parameters in variables
--------------------------------

You can also pull the parameters out in the function as a tuple and a dict:

.. code-block:: ipython

    def f(*args, **kwargs):
        print("the positional arguments are:", args)
        print("the keyword arguments are:", kwargs)

    In [389]: f(2, 3, this=5, that=7)
    the positional arguments are: (2, 3)
    the keyword arguments are: {'this': 5, 'that': 7}

This can be very powerful...

Passing a dict to str.format()
-------------------------------

Now that you know that keyword args are really a dict,
you know how this nifty trick works:

The string ``format()`` method takes keyword arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(last="Barker", first="Chris")
    Out[24]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

Build a dict of the keys and values:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [25]: d = {"last":"Barker", "first":"Chris"}

And pass to ``format()``with ``**``

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: "My name is {first} {last}".format(**d)
    Out[26]: 'My name is Chris Barker'

LAB
----

.. rst-class:: medium

  keyword arguments:

* Write a function that has four optional parameters (with defaults):

  - fore_color
  - back_color
  - link_color
  - visited_color

* Have it print the colors (use strings for the colors)
* Call it with a couple different parameters set
* Have it pull the parameters out with ``*args, **kwargs``
  - and print those

=====================================
A bit more on mutability (and copies)
=====================================

mutable objects
----------------

We've talked about this: mutable objects can have their contents changed in place.

Immutable objects can not.

This has implications when you have a container with mutable objects in it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [28]: list1 = [ [1,2,3], ['a','b'] ]

one way to make a copy of a list:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [29]: list2 = list1[:]

    In [30]: list2 is list1
    Out[30]: False

they are different lists.

.. nextslide::

What if we set an element to a new value?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [31]: list1[0] = [5,6,7]

    In [32]: list1
    Out[32]: [[5, 6, 7], ['a', 'b']]

    In [33]: list2
    Out[33]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b']]

So they are independent.

.. nextslide::

But what if we mutate an element?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [34]: list1[1].append('c')

    In [35]: list1
    Out[35]: [[5, 6, 7], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [36]: list2
    Out[36]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

uuh oh! mutating an element in one list mutated the one in the other list.

.. nextslide::

Why is that?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [38]: list1[1] is list2[1]
    Out[38]: True

The elements are the same object!

This is known as a "shallow" copy -- Python doesn't want to copy more than it needs to, so in this case, it makes a new list, but does not make copies of the contents.

Same for dicts (and any container type -- even tuples!)

If the elements are immutable, it doesn't really make a differnce -- but be very careful with mutable elements.


The copy module
----------------

most objects have a way to make copies (``dict.copy()`` for instance).

but if not, you can use the ``copy`` module to make a copy:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [39]: import copy

    In [40]: list3 = copy.copy(list2)

    In [41]: list3
    Out[41]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

This is also a shallow copy.

.. nextslide::

But there is another option:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: list1
    Out[3]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [4]: list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1)

    In [5]: list1[0].append(4)

    In [6]: list1
    Out[6]: [[1, 2, 3, 4], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

    In [7]: list2
    Out[7]: [[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

``deepcopy`` recurses through the object, making copies of everything as it goes.

.. nextslide::


I happened on this thread on stack overflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3975376/understanding-dict-copy-shallow-or-deep

The OP is pretty confused -- can you sort it out?

Make sure you understand the difference between a reference, a shallow copy, and a deep copy.

Mutables as default arguments:
------------------------------

Another "gotcha" is using mutables as default arguments:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: def fun(x, a=[]):
       ....:     a.append(x)
       ....:     print(a)
       ....:

This makes sense: maybe you'd pass in a specific list, but if not, the default is an empty list.

But:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: fun(3)
    [3]

    In [13]: fun(4)
    [3, 4]

Huh?!

.. nextslide::

Remember that that default argument is defined when the function is created: there will be only one list, and every time the function is called, that same list is used.


The solution:

The standard practice for such a mutable default argument:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [15]: def fun(x, a=None):
       ....:     if a is None:
       ....:         a = []
       ....:     a.append(x)
       ....:     print(a)
    In [16]: fun(3)
    [3]
    In [17]: fun(4)
    [4]

You get a new list every time the function is called



===================
Anonymous functions
===================

lambda
------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [171]: f = lambda x, y: x+y
    In [172]: f(2,3)
    Out[172]: 5

Content of function can only be an expression -- not a statement

Anyone remember what the difference is?

Called "Anonymous": it doesn't get a name.

.. nextslide::

It's a python object, it can be stored in a list or other container

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [7]: l = [lambda x, y: x+y]
    In [8]: type(l[0])
    Out[8]: function


And you can call it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [9]: l[0](3,4)
    Out[9]: 7


Functions as first class objects
---------------------------------

You can do that with "regular" functions too:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: def fun(x,y):
       ....:     return x+y
       ....:
    In [13]: l = [fun]
    In [14]: type(l[0])
    Out[14]: function
    In [15]: l[0](3,4)
    Out[15]: 7



======================
Functional Programming
======================

No real consensus about what that means.

But there are some "classic" methods available in Python.

map
---

``map``  "maps" a function onto a sequence of objects -- It applies the function to each item in the list, returning another list


.. code-block:: ipython

    In [23]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [24]: def fun(x):
                 return x*2 + 10
    In [25]: map(fun, l)
    Out[25]: [14, 20, 24, 34, 22, 18]


But if it's a small function, and you only need it once:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [26]: map(lambda x: x*2 + 10, l)
    Out[26]: [14, 20, 24, 34, 22, 18]


filter
------

``filter``  "filters" a sequence of objects with a boolean function --
It keeps only those for which the function is True -- filtering our the rest.

To get only the even numbers:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [27]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [28]: filter(lambda x: not x%2, l)
    Out[28]: [2, 12, 6, 4]

If you pass ``None`` to ``filter()``, you get only items that evaluate to true:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: l = [1, 0, 2.3, 0.0, 'text', '', [1,2], [], False, True, None ]

    In [2]: filter(None, l)
    Out[2]: [1, 2.3, 'text', [1, 2], True]


reduce
------

``reduce``  "reduces" a sequence of objects to a single object with a function that combines two arguments

To get the sum:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [30]: l = [2, 5, 7, 12, 6, 4]
    In [31]: reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, l)
    Out[31]: 36


To get the product:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [32]: reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, l)
    Out[32]: 20160

or

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [13]: import operator
    In [14]: reduce(operator.mul, l)
    Out[14]: 20160

Comprehensions
--------------

Couldn't you do all this with comprehensions?

Yes:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [33]: [x+2 + 10 for x in l]
    Out[33]: [14, 17, 19, 24, 18, 16]

    In [34]: [x for x in l if not x%2]
    Out[34]: [2, 12, 6, 4]

    In [6]: l
    Out[6]: [1, 0, 2.3, 0.0, 'text', '', [1, 2], [], False, True, None]
    In [7]: [i for i in l if i]
    Out[7]: [1, 2.3, 'text', [1, 2], True]

(Except Reduce)

But Guido thinks almost all uses of reduce are really ``sum()``

Functional Programming
----------------------

Comprehensions and map, filter, reduce are all "functional programming" approaches}

``map, filter``  and ``reduce``  pre-date comprehensions in Python's history

Some people like that syntax better

And "map-reduce" is a big concept these days for parallel processing of "Big Data" in NoSQL databases.

(Hadoop, MongoDB, etc.)


A bit more about lambda
------------------------

It is very useful for specifying sorting as well:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [55]: lst = [("Chris","Barker"), ("Fred", "Jones"), ("Zola", "Adams")]

    In [56]: lst.sort()

    In [57]: lst
    Out[57]: [('Chris', 'Barker'), ('Fred', 'Jones'), ('Zola', 'Adams')]

    In [58]: lst.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    In [59]: lst
    Out[59]: [('Zola', 'Adams'), ('Chris', 'Barker'), ('Fred', 'Jones')]

lambda in keyword arguments
----------------------------

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [186]: l = []
    In [187]: for i in range(3):
        l.append(lambda x, e=i: x**e)
       .....:
    In [189]: for f in l:
        print(f(3))
    1
    3
    9

Note when the keyword argument is evaluated: this turns out to be very handy!

Here's an exercise to try out some of this:

:ref:`exercise_lambda_magic`

==============
dict as switch
==============

What to use instead of "switch-case"?

switch-case
-----------

A number of languages have a "switch-case" construct::

    switch(argument) {
        case 0:
            return "zero";
        case 1:
            return "one";
        case 2:
            return "two";
        default:
            return "nothing";
    };

How do you spell this in python?

``if-elif`` chains
-------------------

The obvious way to spell it is a chain of ``elif`` statements:

.. code-block:: python

    if argument ==  0:
        return "zero"
    elif argument == 1:
        return "one"
    elif argument == 2:
        return "two"
    else:
        return "nothing"

And there is nothing wrong with that, but....

.. nextslide::

The ``elif`` chain is neither elegant nor efficient. There are a number of ways to spell it in python -- but one elgant one is to use a dict:

.. code-block:: python

    arg_dict = {0:"zero", 1:"one", 2: "two"}
        dict.get(argument, "nothing")

Simple, elegant, and fast.

You can do a dispatch table by putting functions as the value.

Example: Chris' mailroom2 solution.

==============================
Closures and function Currying
==============================

Defining specialized functions on the fly

Closures
--------

"Closures" and "Currying" are cool CS terms for what is really just defining functions on the fly.

you can find a "proper" definition here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)

but I even have trouble following that.

So let's go straight to an example:

.. nextslide::

.. code-block:: python

    def counter(start_at=0):
        count = [start_at]
        def incr():
            count[0] += 1
            return count[0]
        return incr

What's going on here?

We have stored the ``start_at`` value in a list.

Then defined a function, ``incr`` that adds one to the value in the list, and returns that value.

[ Quiz: why is it: ``count = [start_at]``, rather than just ``count=start_at`` ]

.. nextslide::

So what type of object do you get when you call ``counter()``?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [37]: c = counter(start_at=5)

    In [38]: type(c)
    Out[38]: function

So we get a function back -- makes sense. The ``def`` defines a function, and that function is what's getting returned.

Being a function, we can, of course, call it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [39]: c()
    Out[39]: 6

    In [40]: c()
    Out[40]: 7

Each time is it called, it increments the value by one.

.. nextslide::

But what happens if we call ``counter()`` multiple times?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [41]: c1 = counter(5)

    In [42]: c2 = counter(10)

    In [43]: c1()
    Out[43]: 6

    In [44]: c2()
    Out[44]: 11

So each time ``counter()`` is called, a new function is created. And that function has its own copy of the ``count`` object. This is what makes in a "closure" -- it carries with it the scope in which is was created.

the returned ``incr`` function is a "curried" function -- a function with some parameters pre-specified.

``functools.partial``
---------------------

The ``functools`` module in the standard library provides utilities for working with functions:

https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html

Creating a curried function turns out to be common enough that the ``functools.partial`` function provides an optimized way to do it:

What functools.partial does is:

 * Makes a new version of a function with one or more arguments already filled in.
 * The new version of a function documents itself.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    def power(base, exponent):
        """returns based raised to the give exponent"""
        return base ** exponent

Simple enough. but what if we wanted a specialized ``square`` and ``cube`` function?

We can use ``functools.partial`` to *partially* evaluate the function, giving us a specialized version:

square = partial(power, exponent=2)
cube = partial(power, exponent=3)
