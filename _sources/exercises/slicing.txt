Slicing Lab
***********

Goal
====

Get the basics of sequence slicing down

Tasks
-----

Write some functions that:

* return a string with the first and last characters exchanged.
* return a string with every other character removed
* return a string with the first and last 4 characters removed, and every other char in between
* return a string reversed (just with slicing)
* return a string with the middle, then last, then first third in the new order

NOTE: these should work with ANY sequence -- not just strings!
