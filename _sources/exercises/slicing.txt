Goal
====

Get the basics of sequence slicing down

Tasks
-----

Write some functions that:

* return a sequence with the first and last items exchanged.
* return a sequence with every other item removed
* return a sequence with the first and last 4 items removed, and every other item in between
* return a sequence reversed (just with slicing)
* return a sequence with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order

NOTE:
these should work with ANY sequence -- but you can use strings to test, if you like.
